# CognizantDemo
The app shows a login screen whereby the user can login and view a list of animals. 

The user can also search for specific animals using the built-in search bar. The app makes uses of SwiftUI for most part of the app, however UIKit is also used, mainly for searchbar. 

Code required to acheive this functionality is quite little. Most of the code is for styling the UI elements.
